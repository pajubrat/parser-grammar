Updates to documentation (version 6x)

The latest available documentation is incorrect and will be revised later (version 7x) with respect to

a) file structure

The standard Python packaging is now used, with all modules inside /lpparse directory

b) basic use case

The script can be launched by writing 'python lpparse' in the command prompt at the main directory

c) use of configuration files

The script can be configured by modifying two configuration_data files, one for the whole study
in the main directly and another inside the study directory. Image parameters are also provided
inside these files, and command line arguments are no longer needed or accepted. It is no longer
required that the user edits the Python script itself.

d) there is much more accurate analytics output for quantitative results, and the output is provided 
in csv format that can be read into pandas dataframes and processed there.
