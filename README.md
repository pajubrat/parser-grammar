Linear phase parser
2020

The linear phase parser simulates human language comprehension. The program was originally created at IUSS, Pavia, in a research project "ProGraM-PC: A Processing-friendly Grammatical Model for Parsing and predicting on-line Complexity".

To run the program, you must have python installed and configured at your machine. After cloning the repository, type 'python lpparse.py' into command prompt inside the folder where the package is installed. This command will process all sentences from the test corpus file. The test corpus file and its path are defined in the local_file_system module that can be found inside /lpparse folder. See documentation in the /docs folder.
