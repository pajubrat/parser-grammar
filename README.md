Linear phase grammar
Pauli Brattico
2024

The linear phase grammar (LPG) implements one approach to computational generative grammar (CGG). The kernel of the program was created between 2018-2020 when the author was working as a researcher at IUSS, Pavia, and was then continued as an independent project.

The script, written in Python, should work in all major platforms, but the graphical interface component has been currently tested only for Windows.

The program can be installed by cloning or copying it from the software repository (https://www.github.com/pajubrat/parser-grammar). If the user has Python installed on the local machine, it will normally come preconfigured in a state that should run some particular study from start to finish. The script can be executed by writing "python lpparse" in the command prompt in the installation directory. The graphical user interface can be launched by command "python lpparse -app". 

The program is not a tool for creating grammars; rather, the scientific hypothesis underlying it has been coded in Python and then embedded inside computational infrastructure that verifies it against any dataset. There also many additional analytic tools. In general, however, this means that the script or some version of the script that is downloaded from the repository is always a model of some particular data associated with some particular study.
