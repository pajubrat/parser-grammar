2022

The linear phase parser analyses language by simulating human language comprehension. The program was originally created at IUSS, Pavia, in a research project "ProGraM-PC: A Processing-friendly Grammatical Model for Parsing and predicting on-line Complexity". The system is a tool for linguistics and language comprehension research.
