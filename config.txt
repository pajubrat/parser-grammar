# CONFIG.TXT
# This file can be used to provide the study parameters. It is optional and can be overridden by providing the same parameters
# in the function call as input parameters. If nothing is provided, default values are used (which target the /study-0 folder).
#
# Format is 'parameter: value' (see examples below)
#
# study_folder = the folder which is used to store all results and to read input parameters
# lexicon_folder = the folder which is used to read the lexicon files (lexicon.txt, redundancy_rules.txt, ug_morphemes.txt)
# test_corpus_file = the name of the test corpus
# test_corpus_folder = the folder of the test corpus
#
# Note: because the study folder and the corpus folder can be different, it is possile to use the same corpus for several studies
